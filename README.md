#### 👻 A little bit about me
I started coding in 2017. Since then, my life has been revolving around coding and technology.
Soon I'll be surfing an AI wave. I'm currently learning how to do that.

I think I'm a **Tech Lead** at **HBS**.

*I need to update my photo...*
*I look pretty young there, would like to be like that right now.*
